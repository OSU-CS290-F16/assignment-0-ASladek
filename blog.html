      <h2> Assignment 0, September 26th 2016 </h2>
      My challenges in the assignment came primarily from lack of experience. I haven't coded in html for years, and I've never <br>
      used github. The review in class was very helpful as an html refresher, but I was still pretty lost when it came to interacting <br>
      with github from the terminal. The posted tutorial was helpful, but kind of a roundabout way of getting the plain command lines <br>
      that I really needed. I went through them a couple times until I got the hang of it. I also used the w3schools webpage as a reference <br>
      when I got stuck with the html. I did not make much use of piazza this time, but I'll be sure to pay closer attention to it next time.
